## Overview

The Product Preview Card component is a visually appealing and interactive element that provides a snapshot of a product. It showcases key details such as product image, name, price, and rating in a compact and intuitive manner. It offers a seamless user experience and can be easily integrated into various web and mobile applications.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
- use too many types of images with different widths and heights in a single element without using too many divs.

### What I learned

In this project, we learned about semantic tags in HTML and custom CSS resets, as well as creating CSS variables. We also explored interesting CSS features like the data-link, grid, and flex. Additionally, we discussed CSS naming conventions..

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
      <picture class="product__img">
        <source srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 600px)">
        <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="">
      </picture>

      <button class="btn" data-icon="shopping-cart">Add to Cart</button>
```
```css
.btn[data-icon="shopping-cart"]::before{
  content: '';
  width: 15px;
  height: 16px;
  background-image: url('../images/icon-cart.svg');
}
```
